\chapter{Introduction}

Since the world's first particle accelerator went online in the 1930's, colliding protons against a fixed lithium target at the Cavendish Laboratory, particle collisions have been providing physicists with portals into the subatomic realm where quantum physics is the supreme ruler.  Progressively, particle accelerators have become more and more powerful, and the depth at which physicists can peer into the atom, into the structure of particles, and eventually into interactions of the most fundamental, has hastened.  Today, we stand at the energy frontier of particle experiments with the Standard Model of Particle Physics, a theory that could appear as a complete map of fundamental particles and interactions, in hand to guide us through the sea of quantum possibilities, while astronomical observations, for one, give us the distinct sense that we are holding only a small slice of the key.  

Another historic event in the 1930's was the first hint of dark matter in astronomical observation.  J.H. Oort, the namesake of the Oort Cloud, measured the velocities of stars using their Doppler shifts.  Surprisingly, the galactic mass that binds them in gravitational orbit should not be strong enough to overcome their velocities, and the stars should escape.  It wasn't until 40 years later that Vera Rubin actually opened the eyes of science to the alarming possibility of a new kind of matter so different from the electrically interacting matter that makes our universe observable, that we call it 'dark'.  Dark matter is now observed to be so abundant in the universe, we believe there is five times more of it than the matter that constitutes all the stars, planets, gas clouds, and anything else made of Standard Model particles.  But this extraordinary matter might not be completely dark.  It might couple to the Standard Model extremely weakly, and when it does, we hope to be there to witness.

The European Organization for Nuclear Research, or Conseil Europ\'een pour la Recherche Nucl\`eaire (CERN), began as an official scientific union between 12 European countries in 1954, when engineers began digging the first hole near Geneva, Switzerland which marked the beginning of a new era of particle physics collisions.  Experiments at CERN have been heros in electroweak physics, with discoveries of the $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ bosons and 1983 with the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), and the discovery the particle that so far sufficiently looks like the Standard Model Higgs boson in 2012 with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  Currently, the LHC is the largest and most powerful accelerator on Earth, colliding protons with a center of mass energy of $13~\TeV$.  With this machine, we step closer to the energy scales of the early universe before thermal freeze-out when the universe became too cold for dark matter production, or any other interactions at the dark matter scale.  There is a chance the LHC will produce dark matter particles if they interact with the electroweak force.  There is also the chance to produce a plethora of other particles that do not account for dark matter, but are motivated by predictive new physics models. 

Some of these models predict a new symmetry, and with this new symmetry, a new particle paired to each the Standard Model particles.  Within these models, a well motivated set of particles are possible that couple to the Higgs and the electroweak gauge bosons at the weak scale and decay to a stable particle that fits the police profile of dark matter.  The LHC is capable of producing these particles if they exist, but if the mass spectrum of the new particles is compressed, meaning the masses are within a few $\GeV$ of each other, the signatures of these events will be hard to resolve in a detector that normally identifies objects above $20 \GeV$.  It takes dedicated teams and a lot of strategy to do physics at the edge of detector limits.  

This thesis presents a search for new compressed electroweak physics marked by "soft', low-momentum leptons and a sufficient amount of energy deduced to have left the detector unseen.  The analysis is broken into three parts.  Part 1 will engage the theories that give context and meaning to this search and also describe the LHC and the particle detector used in the experiment.  Part 2 will describe all the work done in performing the analysis, and Part 3 will overview the uncertainties, results, and interpretations.
