\chapter{Introduction}

Particle accelerators have been around since such and such time and have been the source of the most precise physics measurements and lead to deeper understanding of the most fundamental forces and particles in nature.  Discovery of top quarks at this collider and the W and Z bosons.  Da da da LEP $e^+e^-$ machine blah blah.  The Large Hadron Collider pushing into unseen energy realms has the imminent task of finding the Higgs boson, but that is not all.  There must be more, and it was believed for decades new physics was right around the corner from LEP(and others).
