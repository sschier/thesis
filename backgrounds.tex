\chapter{Background Estimation}
\label{ch:bkg}
Signal regions are specifically designed to be enriched in a signal process of interest, but SM backgrounds can still be present and need to be understood.  This chapter will detail how the SM backgrounds are evaluated for this analysis.  The general background estimation strategy is first discussed in Section~\ref{sec:bkg:summary}.  Next, Section~\ref{sec:bkg:irreduce} focuses on the estimation of irreducible ($t\bar{t}$, $Z(\rightarrow\tau\tau$) + jets, $VV\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu$) backgrounds, and the last Section~\ref{sec:bkg:dy} describes the estimate of backgrounds from instrumental \met. The fake and non-prompt lepton background estimate is discussed is in Chapter~\ref{ch:fakefactor}.

\section{Summary of estimation strategy}
\label{sec:bkg:summary}
The vast majority, and possibly all, LHC pp collisions interact only through Standard Model processes, some of which lead to final states that look the same as Higgsino or slepton signals and pass the signal region cuts.  There are two main types of backgrounds, irreducible and reducible. Irreducible backgrounds are Standard Model processes that produce the same particle final state as our BSM final state.  In this case, Monte Carlo simulation is robust enough to model these background processes so their rates can be estimated in the data.  Reducible backgrounds arise from Standard Model processes that should not produce the same final state as the signal; and yet, because of mismeasurements inside the detector, these events can still pass signal selection cuts.  Table~\ref{tab:bkg:est} succinctly summarizes, from greatest to least contribution, the processes that constitute the SM background in the SRs and the methods used to estimate them. 

For a two soft-lepton, \met{}, and hard jets analysis, the dominant irreducible backgrounds come from $t\bar{t}$, $tW$, $Z(\rightarrow\tau\tau)$+jets, and diboson processes.  A top quark decays to a b-quark and a $W$-boson nearly $100\%$ of the time.  In the event that a b-jet fails the b-tagging algorithm, each $t\bar{t}$ event can look like a diboson event with additional jets and some special topological features.  If both the $W$-bosons decay leptonically, you get two real leptons and \met from the neutrinos.  Similarly, insufficiently b-tagged $tW$ events with leptonically decaying $W$-bosons also supply two real leptons, jets, and real \met from neutrinos.  Even when one or both of the $W$-bosons decay hadronically, the $tW$ and $t\bar{t}$ processes can still produce backgrounds in the SRs.  This happens when one or two of the signal leptons arise from jets faking leptons in the detector.  These contributions are accounted for in the data-driven fake estimates.  

In $Z(\rightarrow\tau\tau)$+jets, each leptonically decaying $\tau$-lepton produces one charged lepton and two neutrinos.  Together with the hadronic ISR radiation, that produces a final state with two leptons, real \met from the four neutrinos, and additional jets.  On the occasion that these leptons form an SFOS pair, this process will mimic signal events.  The top and $Z(\rightarrow\tau\tau)$+jets backgrounds are estimated with a semi-data-driven approach where the estimate is done in dedicated control regions enriched in the particular process.

Diboson events are $WW$, $ZZ$, and $WZ$.   These backgrounds are evaluated with a combination of Monte Carlo and a data-driven estimate in a validation region that exploits $\met/H_T$.  Fully leptonic WW production is the most prominent diboson background in the two lepton plus \met signal region.  The fully leptonic WW decays lead to two real leptons that likely have opposite charge, but are not necessarily of the same flavor.  The real \met in the event comes from the neutrinos, and an additional hard jet must be present.  Fully leptonic WZ events can also make their way into the SRs since there is certainly an oppositely signed same flavor lepton pair from the Z, and real \met from the neutrino in the W decay, but since the SRs require exactly two leptons, the third lepton must fail identification for this kind of event be selected.  Semi-leptonic ZZ and WZ processes can pass SR selection if one Z decays into a proper lepton pair and the quarks from the other vector boson induce enough \met to pass the \met trigger.  Lastly, in the fully hadronic cases, there are four jets, two of which must be misidentified as leptons, leaving the others to induce a significant amount of \met.  Fully hadronic contributions are negligible.    

Drell-Yan events, when a quark and an antiquark annihilate into and lepton/anti-lepton pair through the virtual exchange of a $\gamma^*/Z$, contribute to the SM backgrounds in Higgsino and slepton samples when enough \met is generated through jet energy mismeasurements.  Requiring \met{} above 200 GeV in the SRs causes the rate of this process to be low; therefore, Monte Carlo techniques are sufficient for estimating Drell-Yan backgrounds.  Other contributions estimated with pure Monte Carlo techniques are rare processes from: Higgs, triboson, and muti-top\footnote{Multi-top refers to the production or more that two top quarks in an event} production.

\textcolor{red}{Mention lepton truth matching in Monte Carlo.    While detector effects that result in the misidentification of physics objects are not well modeled in simulation, misidentification still occurs during reconstruction.  Reducible fake lepton backgrounds are estimated with a data-driven method and therefore are already accounted for.  Background estimated done in Monte Carlo use only truth matched leptons to prevent overlap in the MC and data-driven estimates. }

\section{Irreducible Backgrounds}
\label{sec:bkg:irreduce}
This section describes the semi-data-driven techniques used to evaluate the irreducible $t\bar{t}$, $tW$, $Z(\rightarrow\tau\tau)$+jets, and diboson backgrounds.  The approach to the $t\bar{t}$, $tW$, and $Z(\rightarrow\tau\tau)$+jets estimates requires defining new kinematic regions, called \textit{control regions} (CRs), that are enriched with these backgrounds.  The Monte Carlo simulated events for these backgrounds in the SRs are then normalized in a simultaneous fit with their corresponding CR to constrain their contribution to the SR.  This fitting procedure it described in Chapter~\ref{ch:statanal}.  For this method to be valid, a CR must select a set of events orthogonal to the SR to remain free of signal contamination, but still be kinematically similar to the SRs for a meaningful extrapolation of the Monte Carlo.  To validate the extrapolation of Monte Carlo events in the SR to data events in the CR, a third region is defined called a \textit{validation region} (VR) that lies somewhere between the CR and SR and is orthogonal to both.

\subsection{Top Control Region (CR-top)}
The control region designed for the $t\bar{t}$ and $tW$ estimates (CR-top) is defined in this section.  One of the most unique aspect of the top-quark signature is the presence of a b-jet.  To enrich a dilepton sample in top quarks, at least one b-tagged jet is required in each event.  CR-top is centered around this requirement.  The dilepton invariant mass is restricted to $m_{\ell\ell}<60~\GeV$ to stay kinematically consistent with the dilepton signal region.  \textcolor{red}{Ask Mike about $\met/H_T$ criteria}  The top-quark and the W decay widths to electrons versus muons is identical; so, unlike in the SRs, different-flavor lepton pairs are probabilistically the same as same-flavor and are also accepted in the CR-top selection.  Other than the b-jet requirement, the slightly different $\met/H_T$ cut, and the inclusion of different flavor lepton pairs, CR-top includes all the common signal region cuts in Table~\ref{tab:cSR}. Figures~\ref{fig:CR-top-1} and~\ref{fig:CR-top-2} show pre-fit CR-top distributions of some of the variables used to define the Higgsino and slepton signal regions.  The purity of $t\bar{t}$ and $tW$ events in CR-top is $72\%$ with a signal contamination of less than $3\$$

\subsection{Ditau Control Region (CR-tau)}
The control region used to estimate $Z\rightarrow\tau\tau$ + jets backgrounds (CR-tau) is defined in this section.  Getting a handle of the invariant mass of a ditau system is the clearest approach to constructing a dilepton sample enriched in $Z\rightarrow\tau\tau$ + jets events, and the $m_{\tau\tau}$ variable, described in section~\ref{sec:sr:discvar}, is a good proxy for this.  Events in CR-tau are required to have an $m_{\tau\tau}$ between $60 \GeV$ and $120 \GeV$ as a way to envelope the $Z$ mass.  There are also upper and lower bounds on $\met/H_T$.  Just like with CR-top, lepton universality makes different-flavor lepton pairs probabilistically equivalent to same-flavor pairs, so they are also accepted in the CR-tau selection.  Figures~\ref{fig:CR-tau-1} and~\ref{fig:CR-tau-2} show pre-fit distributions of the some of the variables used to define the Higgsino and slepton signal regions as show above for CR-top.  The purity of $Z\rightarrow\tau\tau$ + jets events in CR-tau is $80\%$ with a signal contamination of less than $3\$$

\subsection{Diboson Validation Region (VR-VV)}
Constructing a diboson CR that is free of signal contamination and pure enough to diboson event to confidently normalize Monte Carlo simulation to data is not easy.  Therefore, diboson backgrounds are estimated with Monte Carlo samples.  The background estimate and the associated uncertainties are validated in a dedicated kinematic region called the \textit{diboson validation region} (VR-VV).  This region uses all the same selection cuts as the common signal region in Table~\ref{tab:cSR} with an additional $\met/H_T<3.0$ requirement.  \textcolor{red}{Again, talk to Mike about how to explain the $\met/H_T$ selection}  signal samples should populate high $H_T$, so the $\met/H_T<3.0$ requirement reduces signal contamination.  Figures~\ref{} and\ref{} show VR-VV distributions of some of the variables used to define the Higgsino and slepton signal regions.  The VR-VV composition is approximately $40\%$ diboson events, $25\%$ fake/non-prompt leptons events, $23\%$ $t\bar{t}$ and $tW$ events, about $5\%$ $Z\rightarrow\tau\tau$ + jets events, and not more than $8\%$ signal events.

\subsection{Different flavor validation regions}
Additional validation regions are established to check the extrapolation of the fitted Monte Carlo predictions of the irreducible top and ditau backgrounds in the inclusive and exclusive Higgsino and slepton SR, defined in Chapter~\ref{ch:sr}.  These VRs take advantage of the flavor symmetry of the $t\bar{t}$, $tW$, $Z(\rightarrow\tau\tau)$+jets processes by selecting only events with different-flavor same-sign lepton pairs in concert with all the other signal region cuts.  This includes the inclusive and exclusive binning in $m_{\ell\ell}$ and $m_{t2}$ that define the Higgsino and slepton signal regions.

\section{Drell-Yan Background}
\label{sec:bkg:dy}
As mentioned in~\ref{sec:bkg:summary} Drell-Yan backgrounds are estimated with Monte Carlo samples.  The background contribution from this process is mitigated by SR cuts
Refer to DY figures

Two strategies are employed to reduce this background, what are they?

After reducing this as much as possible, Monte Carlo estimates the remaining piece.
