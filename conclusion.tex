A search for supersymmetry in scenarios with compressed mass spectra was performed using ATLAS data collected in 2015 and 2016 at $\sqrt(s)$ 13 TeV, corresponding to $36.1 fb^{-1}$.  We searched for directly produced electroweakinos and sleptons in events containing two soft, oppositely signed and same flavored leptons and including missing transverse momentum energy recoiling against initial state hadronic radiation.  The directly produced electroweakinos and sleptons subsequently decay to their Standard Model partners and the lightest SUSY particle which is nearly degenerate in mass.  No significant excess in data over Standard Model background was found; therefore, results were consistent with Standard Model prediction.
